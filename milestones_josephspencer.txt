Milestones for our stock market simulator/predictor project:

- Do research about the stock market and try to learn more about various
equations that are currently used to predict the stock market future

- Do additional research on Python, which is the language that we
currently plan on coding our project in

- Find / download files that contain historical data on the stock market
that can be used in the creation of our algorithms

- Develop our own algorithm for predicting the stock market based on our
own examinations of current algorithms

- Do additional research on different types of data structures and
decide on which ones would be best for accomplishing our project's
goals



Rubric:

15 points: Identify and impliment the best kind of data structure for
this project

15 points: Create an algorithm / series of algorithms that predicts or
simulations the future of the stock market

10 points: Research and use the Python language with our code
