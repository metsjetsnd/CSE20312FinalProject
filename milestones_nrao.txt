*Nathan Rao project milestones

Milestones
==========

1. Research financial markets and learn about how they work, what
areas we would like to work in, and connect the gathered information
to data structures in some way.

2. Research current predictive market algorithms and determine how
they apply to their financial sector and how data structures can more
effectively handle and manipulate data.

3. Determine how to export data from various files on the financial 
market into manipulatable data in Python.

4. Apply research to begin development of a data structures centered
algorithm for determining investments.
